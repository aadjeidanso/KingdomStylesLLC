            <p>Christdia does a great job and I can tell she loves what she does. She pays close attention to the details
                and has multiple girls helping her do each braid so it goes by faster. She was the first person to ever
                give me braids and I have gone back again just a month later...</p>

            <p>Great place. I definitely had an awesome experience and I just can’t wait to go back. The owner herself
                did my hair, I just couldn’t be any happier. Additionally, the salon is super clean/organized and the
                personnel is very friendly as well.</p>

            <p>This was the fastest I've ever had my hair done, in and out in under 4 hours and I have around 18 inches
                of natural hair, got medium waist length knotless braids. Medium here is small in other places - I think
                if you choose small knotless it'd be microbraids!</p>
